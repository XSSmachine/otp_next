# AI Assistant Webview Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented an integrated webview that opens the OTP Bank Customer Assistant ChatGPT link when the AI assistant button is clicked.

## What was implemented:

### 1. Added webview dependency

- Added `webview_flutter: ^4.4.2` to `pubspec.yaml`

### 2. Created AI Assistant Screen (`lib/screens/ai_assistant_screen.dart`)

- Full-screen webview that loads: `https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6831913ecd8c819194baac8fc4e6f9bc-otp-bank-customer-assistant`
- Loading indicator with OTP Bank branding colors
- Navigation controls (back, forward, home buttons)
- Refresh functionality
- Consistent dark theme matching the app design

### 3. Updated existing screens

- **Panoramic Viewer Screen**: AI Assistant button now navigates to webview instead of showing dialog
- **Digitalna Poslovnica Screen**: AI agent button now navigates to webview instead of showing snackbar

## Features included:

- ✅ Loading spinner while the ChatGPT page loads
- ✅ Navigation controls (back/forward/home)
- ✅ Refresh button in app bar
- ✅ Dark theme consistent with OTP Bank app design
- ✅ Proper error handling for web resources
- ✅ JavaScript enabled for full ChatGPT functionality

## Next Steps:

1. Run `flutter pub get` to install the webview dependency
2. Test the functionality by clicking the AI Assistant buttons in:
   - Panoramic Viewer Screen (top cards)
   - Digitalna Poslovnica Screen

## Technical Details:

- Uses `webview_flutter` package for reliable webview implementation
- WebView controller configured with JavaScript enabled
- Proper navigation delegation for better user experience
- Loading states managed with proper UI feedback

The implementation provides a seamless integration of the OTP Bank Customer Assistant ChatGPT into your Flutter app, maintaining the app's design language while providing full ChatGPT functionality.
